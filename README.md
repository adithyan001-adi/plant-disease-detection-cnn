# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project aims to build a **deep learning–based image classification system** to identify plant diseases from leaf images.

🚧 **Project Status:** In Progress  
(Currently setting up project structure and environment)

---

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Classify plant leaf images into **healthy or diseased categories**
- Support **multiple plant disease classes**
- Use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image-based classification

---

## 🧠 Planned Approach

- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Data augmentation for better generalization
- CNN-based architecture using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization using confusion matrix

---

## 📂 Dataset (Planned)

**New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)** – Kaggle  
(The dataset will not be included in this repository due to size constraints.)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies (Planned)

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab (GPU)

---
